# Culture

## Life at GitLab
It’s an exciting time to be part of GitLab. We're a fast-growing, all-remote team, and we're looking for people to join us around the world. Here's a look at what you can expect from our culture and all-remote environment.

### Everyone can contribute
Our size and our mission (that everyone can contribute) mean that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the company.

Because we all use our product internally, you don't have to be a developer to learn to collaborate in the GitLab tool. From your very first week, no matter your role, you'll gain the technical skills needed to access, question, and contribute to projects far beyond your job description.

This unique approach works because we're a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, the company, and the broader GitLab community succeed. We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other.

Come prepared to do meaningful work that will help shape the future of the company.

While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like GitLab, they may not be clearly defined. You'll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to try something new.

### Freedom to iterate
At GitLab, our value of iteration has a unique impact on the way we operate and get things done.

Working this way means our team members are expected to quickly deliver the minimum viable change in their work instead of waiting to produce a polished, completed product.

While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it's liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster.

As our company and the industry continue to grow, you'll have the freedom to change and constantly evolve everything from your schedule and your workspace to your job description and your skills.

## Advantages
Top 10 reasons to work for GitLab:

- Work remote so you have no commute and are free to travel and move.
- Have flexible work hours so you are there for other people and free to plan the day how you like.

- Work on a product you use every day: we drink our own wine.
- Work on a product used by lots of people that care about what you do.
- As a company we contribute more than we take, most of our work is released as the open source GitLab CE.

- Open internal processes: know what you're getting in to and be assured we're thoughtful and effective.
