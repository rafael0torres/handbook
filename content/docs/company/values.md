# Values

## About our values
We take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for the boring solutions. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. GitLab values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business.

We used to have more values, but it was difficult to remember them all, so we condensed them and gave sub-values and created an acronym.

Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.

## Sub-values as substantiators
The "sub" in sub-value is not in reference to "subordinate," but rather, "substantiate." Sub-values define top-level values, and are most easily lived out. You may see other companies with some of our top-level values, though our unique collection of sub-values are critical to add context and remove ambiguity.

Sub-values clarify what a given value means and looks like at GitLab. Understanding this distinction is critical to thriving at GitLab, particularly for newer team members who may be familiar with a prior organization's interpretation of iteration or collaboration (as examples).
